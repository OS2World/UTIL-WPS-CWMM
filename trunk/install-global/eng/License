In the past this package was constantly bashed and
the author flamed and insulted far beyond what should
be regarded acceptable between human beings.
This is rather surprising because no user had to pay or
do anything to get this product, it's free to use or - not to use.

I want to clarify some points.

1. This is a free time project. There's no obligation for
    me to give support or do anything I don't want to do. 

2. Everybody who thinks he will get a solution for a particular
    problem by insulting me or others and yelling around should
    work to improve his social skills.

3. There're technical reasons why certain parts of this product
    are implemented the way they are. If anybody doesn't like a
    particular implementation feel free to present a better solution
    but don't waste my time with useless discussions just to have
    the last word.

4. As for most people my day only consists of 24 hours.

5. If the product doesn't work for you, just use the original classes
    coming with OS/2. There's no obligation for anybody to use
    this package at all!
