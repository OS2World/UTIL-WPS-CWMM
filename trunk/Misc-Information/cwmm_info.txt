Installation
----------

1. IBM classes must be deinstalled
2. MMPARTS.DLL must be copied out of the libpath
3. ab.exe and ib.exe must be copied into the MMPARTS.DLL directory.
4. In user INI there must be pointers to the new location of these programs. Keys: CWMM->ab and CWMM->ib

Programming
------------
1.
During installation the MMPARTS.DLL is copied out of the LIBPATH. ab.exe and ib.exe are copied to the new
location of MMPARTS.DLL. The new location of these programs is written to user-ini under the keys CWMM->ab
and CWMM->ib.
In the wpOpen() method of MMAudio and MMImage this new location is queried to start the respective programs
(image and audio editor). When the editor apps finally are replaced this can be changed.

2.
Creating of *.hh files from IDL files:

sc -shh -S 64000  -m noqualifytypes <filename_without_ext>
