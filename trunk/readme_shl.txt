
How the Trunk was Built

2017-07-12 SHL Baseline

The trunk was built from the contents of the zip files stashed in
tags/imported-zips.

The zip files are dirty in the sense that they contain a combination of
build sources, backup files, build products and some other cruft.

This initial import was a best efforts to import a buildable set of files.
However, it is not unlikely that some files were missed.  If so, they should
be found in one of the zip files and should be "svn added" to the trunk.

It is also likely that some build products where committed to the trunk.  If
so, they should be "svn removed" from the trunk.

Have fun
