/* rexx - Return all image extensions we have a MM class for.   
   This script is called by M_MMImage and mmfind.exe. After getting the extensions
   M_MMImage checks if there're any additional extensions handled by
   installed image IO procedures. If yes, these unhandled extensions
   are associated with the MMImage class so lighttable folder and
   image editor are working.
